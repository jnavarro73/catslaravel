As territorial animals, our cats are constantly wondering why we’re not doing other cat things that the big cat would normally do in their territory. In fact, the “let me in, let me out, let me in” phenomenon is a good example. The bigger cat ostensibly rules the territory and therefore should be the one patrolling and marking it with pee so other cats stay away. But since humans don’t do this, indoor-outdoor cats reluctantly take on the role themselves. The apparent neuroticism of cats wanting to go outside every five minutes only to be let right back in is funny to us because it seems so silly and unnecessary. But to the cats, it’s very necessary (and frustrating) to cover for their dumb pals.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"5a9ac18c7478810ea6c06381","name":{"first":"Alex","last":"Wohlbruck"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58cafac6ffae36001108d586","text":"Cats have fur","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58c86fe52341fc0011d7b151","name":{"first":"Alex","last":"Simon"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e007cc0aac31001185ecf5","text":"Cats are the most popular pet in the United States: There are 88 million pet cats and 74 million dogs.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e008510aac31001185ecfe","text":"In tigers and tabbies, the middle of the tongue is covered in backward-pointing spines, used for breaking off and gripping meat.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e008c50aac31001185ed0e","text":"The world's richest cat is worth $13 million after his human passed away and left her fortune to him.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e008630aac31001185ed01","text":"When cats grimace, they are usually \"taste-scenting.\" They have an extra organ that, with some breathing control, allows the cats to taste-sense the air.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e008a30aac31001185ed0b","text":"A cat's purr may be a form of self-healing, as it can be a sign of nervousness as well as contentment.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e008d00aac31001185ed0f","text":"Your cat recognizes your voice but just acts too cool to care (probably because they are).","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e00a850aac31001185ed1a","text":"Cats have a longer-term memory than dogs, especially when they learn by actually doing rather than simply seeing.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e00b3a0aac31001185ed20","text":"Polydactyl cats are also referred to as \"Hemingway cats\" because the author was so fond of them.","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e00b5f0aac31001185ed24","text":"When asked if her husband had any hobbies, Mary Todd Lincoln is said to have replied \"cats.\"","type":"cat","user":{"_id":"58e007480aac31001185ecef","name":{"first":"Kasimir","last":"Schulz"}},"upvotes":2,"userUpvoted":null},{"_id":"58e00bdb0aac31001185edfd","text":"Cats can change their meow to manipulate a human.
